# reunited üîç

**open-source platform for finding lost stuff and getting back what matters**

## the problem

lose something? good luck finding it. most lost & found systems suck and there's no central place to actually look for your stuff.

## what i built

reunited is basically google for lost items. built it after losing my earphones and having nowhere decent to check if someone found them.

## features that actually matter

- **smart search** - find stuff by date, location, description, whatever
- **magic links** - no password bs, just click to login
- **works on mobile** - obviously, since that's how you'll use it
- **public claim log** - see every successful reunion so you know it's legit
- **direct messaging** - talk to people who found your expensive stuff
- **dashboard** - track all your lost/found items
- **multiple login options** - google, x/twitter, email, whatever works

## the pages

- **home** - how it works + guidelines
- **search** - find your lost stuff with filters
- **dashboard** - manage everything you've lost/found
- **claim log** - proof the system actually works

## tech

vue.js + firebase because they're fast and i don't have to worry about servers. whole thing can work offline too.

## why this exists

tired of losing stuff with no good way to find it. this could save people money, reduce waste, and help get back things that actually mean something.
